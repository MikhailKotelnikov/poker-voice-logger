# Title

Rule Authoring Standard

## Problem

Rules often become vague notes that do not help future execution.

## Rule

When extracting lessons from completed work, then write one atomic, testable rule using the project template, because precise rules are easy to apply and verify.

## Examples

### Positive

- "When editing multiple files, then run targeted checks for each changed module, because local verification catches regressions early."

### Anti-pattern

- "Be careful when changing files."

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] One rule per file
- [ ] Uses concrete trigger and action
- [ ] Includes rationale
